    - 'Ethan: That felt like it took forever! I''m glad we''ve finally landed again.'
    - "Ava: Considering that something has been interfering with our sensors, I'm
      glad we went so slowly. <Pause as portrait switches to \xABgrimacing\xBB before
      the rest of the text appears>\u202FIt beats a crash landing any day.cha"
    - 'Ava: Zoe, have you managed to isolate the interference and adjust for it?
      This is more your area of expertise than mine. '
    - 'Zoe: I''m trying, Ava, but it''s tricky. The frequency of the interference
      keeps shifting around. '

    Dialogue:
    - "Zoe:\u202FYes! Interference is isolated, and shifting frequency is compensated
      for. I'm sending you the data now. "
    - "Ava:\u202FThanks, I'll get our sensors back in working order in a jiffy. "
    - "Leo:\u202FWoah\u2026 what's that up there? "
    - "Ethan:\u202FLight? Down here? How is that even possible? "
    - "3ch3l0n:Hmm\u2026 It would appear that something is generating electromagnetic
      waves with a frequency equal to what humans call visible light. "
    - "Zoe:\u202FLet's check it out! "
    - 'Leo: Our main goal is to determine where the extra oxygen comes from, not
      investigate mysterious light sources. '
    - 'Ethan:Uh, Leo, now that my scanners are working again, they seem to indicate
      that the oxygen is probably coming from the same place as that light. '
    - "Zoe: So\u2026 how do we get up there? "

    Dialogue:
    - 'Ethan:Woah! Unlike the atmosphere outside, the oxygen levels and atmospheric
      pressure here are high enough that we can survive without our helmets. '
    - 'Zoe: You mean we can take these off?! [Reaches for helmet and starts to remove
      it]'
    - "Ava & Leo: Wait\u2013! "
    - "Zoe: [Pulls helmet off and sniffs the air] Huh, the air doesn't smell stagnant,
      which one might expect. It certainly isn't musty, as that would require a lot
      of moisture. Maybe it's slightly\u2026 earthy? "
    - 'Ethan: [Pulls off his own helmet and sniffs the air] Huh, you''re right. Though
      maybe it''d be better to say it smells Marsy? In any case, I can smell a mineral-like
      tang in the air. '
    - "Ava & Leo: WTF?! \u2026"
    - '3ch3l0n: Even if the atmosphere is breathable for humans, it was probably
      a foolish idea to remove your helmets in such an alien environment. '
    - 'Zoe & Ethan: Oops. '
    - "Ava:\u202FWell, we might as well join them, Leo. I don't think I could forgive
      myself if something happened to them and not me if I kept this helmet on. [Removes
      helmet]"
    - "Leo:My mom is going to kill me if she finds out about this\u2026 [Removes
      helmet] We might as well leave our helmets next to this tunnel that leads back
      outside. "
    - "3ch3l0n:Humans\u2026 I do not understand how they can be so illogical and
      reckless when it comes to their own safety\u2026 done here "

    - 'Leo: We should continue to proceed with caution. If we get hurt, returning
      to the ship to treat the injuries will likely be difficult. '
    - "3ch3l0n:\xABcheerful\xBB\u202FI am programmed with a wide array of medical
      knowledge. If you get injured, I should be able to treat you. "
    - "Ethan: *Gulp* L-let's not put th-that to the test\u2026 "
    - 'Ava: I''m looking forward to seeing what we''ll discover.'
